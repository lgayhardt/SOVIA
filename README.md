# SOVIA: Sonification of Visual Interactive Art - Monet

SOVIA is an interactive system that enhances Claude Monetâ€™s art with a responsive auditory experiences.  Users can interact with the painting by moving their curser over the image, when the curser goes over an object detected by the computer vision it will play a sound mapped to that object. 

This project uses [Azure's Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). 

Source code is provided for referance but will not run on it's own because the config and resource files are not provided.

Each time you run the file a random Monet landscape image will be select as well as different sounds for each object type. Computer Vision is then applied to the image to determine the objects presented. Slowly move your mouse across the image to find and hear sounds. 

An internet connection is required since this project uses a prediction model that is stored in Azure.
